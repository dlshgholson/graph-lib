title: TODO

- [x] Establish basic set of features.
- [x] Create general file structure.
- [x] Create makefile.
- [x] Compiles, but fix linker error(s).
- [ ] Complete ``isEquivalentTo()``.
- [ ] Add the following algorithms:
    - [ ] ``bool isStronglyConnected(Graph)``
    - [ ] ``bool isWeaklyConnected(Graph)``
    - [ ] The following BFS variants:
        - [ ] ``Graph bfs(Graph, id_t startNode, size_t radius)``
            - Returns the connected component formed by all discovered nodes.
        - [ ] ``std::vector<Node> bfs(Graph, id_t startNode, id_t targetNode)``
            - Returns the path, if found, from the start to target node. Returns an empty vector otherwise.
    - [ ] Repeat for DFS.
    - [ ] ``bool isAcyclic(Graph)``.
    - [ ] ``std::vector<Node> topologicalSort(Graph)``.
    - [ ] Dijkstra's shortest path.
        - [ ] ``std::vector<Node> bfs(Graph, id_t startNode, id_t targetNode)``
